        <div id="quotes">
          <h2 align="center"> Quotes from Hunter S. Thompson </h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved
              body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly
              proclaiming,"Wow! What a Ride!"</li>
            <li>Hope rises and dreams flicker and die. Love plans for tomorrow and loneliness thinks of yesterday. Life is beautiful
              and living is pain. The sound of music floats down a dark street. </li>
            <li>In a closed society where everyone is guilty, the only crime is getting caught. In a world of thieves, the only
              final sin is stupidity.</li>
            <li>A man who procrastinates in his choosing will inevitably have his choice made for him by circumstances. </li>
            <li>Some may never live, but the crazy never die. </li>
          </ul>
